# Diabetes Risk Analysis and Prediction Project

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the risk of diabetes using health record data. The goal is to identify key factors that influence diabetes risk and provide data-driven recommendations for public health intervention.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set), which includes the following health attributes:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Has diabetes)
