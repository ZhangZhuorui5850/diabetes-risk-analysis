# ðŸ“Œ Project Conclusion

This project aimed to analyze health-related risk factors associated with diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Through a combination of SQL-based analysis (Hive), filtering (Pig), visualization (Python), and predictive modeling (Spark), several key patterns were discovered and translated into practical recommendations.

## âœ… Key Findings

- Individuals with higher BMI and glucose levels were significantly more likely to be diabetic.
- Age was also an important factor, with diabetic patients averaging over 6 years older than non-diabetics.
- Glucose, BMI, and Age showed the strongest correlations with diabetes risk.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Outcomes

- Built a clear, reproducible data analysis pipeline using Hive, Pig, Spark, and Python.
- Generated visual insights to support health-focused recommendations.
- Produced a working logistic regression model for predicting diabetes outcomes.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Limitations

- Some feature values were zero or missing, indicating potential data quality issues.
- The dataset did not include gender, lifestyle, or diet, which may also impact diabetes risk.

## ðŸ“¬ Final Notes

This project demonstrates how health analytics can help prioritize intervention for high-risk groups, improve data quality awareness, and guide public health decisions. The pipeline and analysis can be extended to larger medical datasets for further research or practical deployment.
