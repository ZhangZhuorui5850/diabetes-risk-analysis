In this project, I explored how data management tools like Hive, Pig, and PySpark can be used together to clean data, analyze trends, and build a simple diabetes prediction model.
I started with a dataset with missing and invalid values and first cleaned and prepared the data. Then, I used Hive and Pig on the Ambari platform to group diabetics by age to find out which age group had the highest number of cases. After that, I trained a logistic regression model using PySpark and found that age and blood glucose are the two most important features to predict diabetes.
I also visualized different parts of the dataset using Python and Jupyter. These graphs helped me better understand how age, body mass index, and blood glucose levels differ between diabetics and non-diabetics. For example, I found that diabetics are usually older and have a higher body mass index.
From this I learned that using a combination of different tools gives a clearer picture of the situation than using only one tool. It also made me realize how important clean data and clear visualizations are when doing data analysis. I also learned that even a simple model can work if it is based on the right features.
Overall, this project helped me apply what I learned in class to real-world problems and gave me a better understanding of how data tools work in practice. In this project, I explored how data management tools such as Hive, Pig, and PySpark can be used together to clean data, analyze trends, and build a simple predictive model for diabetes.
